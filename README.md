# NYUAD 360Â° - One Campus, Endless Possibilities

A responsive website showcasing a 90-second documentary about NYU Abu Dhabi campus life. This project serves as a digital companion to the film, featuring interactive elements including a full-screen video presentation, behind-the-scenes image carousel with auto-advance functionality, smooth scroll animations, and parallax effects.

Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, the website includes dynamic navigation with scroll progress tracking, fade-in animations, and an integrated Google Forms feedback system. View the live site at https://salem12912.github.io/NYUAD-360/.
